# 🌱 My Humble Beginning

This repository contains some of my first 🐍 Python programs and beginner-level projects.

It's a collection of simple scripts 🧠 created while learning the basics of programming, exploring logic building, and getting comfortable with Python syntax.

I'm using this space to practice, experiment 🔬, and improve — one step at a time 🚶‍♀️.
